              The purpose of the MBV Mentorship Program is to help veterans pursue <em>meaningful</em> career
              paths that align with their values, strengths, and aspirations. Mentors play a vital role in
              helping students reflect deeply on what matters most and make informed choices that support
              long-term success and fulfillment.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-brand-cool-gray">
              Mentors and students should plan to meet regularly throughout the academic year, either in person
              or virtually, for conversations lasting 30 to 60 minutes. The frequency of meetings may vary based
              on schedules and mutual availability â€“ ideally bi-weekly to monthly. These interactions are intended
              to foster learning, reflection, and professional growth through shared experience and dialogue.
