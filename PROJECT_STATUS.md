## 🎯 Current Priority: Profile Creation

**Goal**: Get mentors and mentees creating profiles in 3-5 days

**What's needed**:
1. Simple auth flow (email/password + Google)
2. Role selection on signup (mentor vs mentee)
3. Comprehensive profile forms
4. Admin view to track who's completed

## 💼 Business Context

- **Program**: MBV (Master in Business for Veterans) at Emory
- **Users**: Veteran mentees, professional mentors
- **Admin**: You (program manager)
- **Timeline**: Need profile creation live in 3-5 days
- **Future**: Expand to other organizations

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

1. **Military-first**: All users must have military background info
2. **Career matching**: Focus on career goals + mentor expertise
3. **Simple first**: Manual matching before AI
4. **Tracked progress**: Admin can see everything
5. **Built-in scheduling**: Keep everything in one place

## 📝 Notes

- Using Supabase for auth, database, and file storage
- Vercel for hosting
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind v4 for styling
- Next.js App Router for modern React patterns

## Next Steps

1. Follow SETUP.md to configure Supabase
2. Run `npm run dev` to see the homepage
3. Let Claude Code know when you're ready to build the auth and profile pages!
